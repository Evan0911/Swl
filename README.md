# Swl
Swl (pronounced like "soul") is a Unity based video game project.
The concept of the game is a to have a soul that incarns themself into different kind of swords with different stats. The game is made for Android (and PC) and is played with doing different movement with your finger, like tap to attack, slide to the side to dodge, etc...

This project is on hold (and mostly abandonned) since several years.
